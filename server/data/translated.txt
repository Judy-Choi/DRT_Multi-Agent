Nettle Milk Play

I had my wisdom teeth extracted.
The wisdom tooth that sat with a strange shape during the root extraction process left my body accompanied by extreme pain.
The pain was so intense that I wanted to pull out every argument entirely.
The bones that were not properly stuck together are now finding their place and interlocking.
I don't want to experience this again. The painful thing is like its owner, so after removing the sutures, I'm left with only thoughts of leisure on my way out.

My friend left the dentist before she could get a bit of revenge on her terrible week ahead by brightly coloring her hair.
Final Translation: Although sitting for a long time was troublesome, the hair color that suited my feelings was very pleasing.
I received praise from my coworkers for doing well, and I didn't particularly dislike their business-related smiles and flattery.

Started shopping.
Even if it were called a condition, I would have been so addicted to shopping that I could not convince myself.
Unlike being left behind by others, I regularly search for [things] to improve myself.
"I was able to take some time to explore regular customer shops again, and I felt a deep yearning for the warm welcome from the shop assistants."
Even if it had been exposed for a long time under bright lights, it did not get tired.
While aimlessly browsing through the arcade, I stuffed my bag with various items before realizing too late that I had no car to transport them in.
The behavior without caring about front or back is similar to a habit. Must change, but it's already too late.

I deeply thought about a solution and then held up my mobile phone.
Quite some time not used for a while, and then saw an outdated model. So went to the dealership and decided on changing his phone as well. For now, he will call.
After a fair amount of time waiting for a response, the unexpected caller suddenly conveys their message through a voice transmission.

Your manly voice, though formal, continues to catch me off guard. You're still able to intimidate me with it.
The fragrance seemed to be transmitted to me, making my longing even more urgent.
Suddenly, right now and immediately, wanting you so much that I forget why I called and neglect my greetings.
When the location is briefly mentioned to me, I sigh and close Flip together.

I gazed into my reflection in the shop window, contemplating myself.
The unfamiliar hair color glistened brightly in the scorching sun, scattering with dazzling brilliance.
This amount of progress is acceptable. He should be able to understand these changes within two years.
While waiting for him, I need to get his mobile phone updated. Of course, I'll have to register his name first.
With a heavy heart, I stepped out of the arcade.

Actually, his reaction when I saw him leaving was truly pitiful (indeed).
"It was a sight so ugly that even his mouth was wide open in astonishment, and yet he admired it with such amazement. How strange this must have seemed."
After joining his father's company, he had really grown into a splendid adult.
A well-fitting suit with an appearance, the sharp shirt with comfortable neckties.
And from the sharpness in his eyes and the gleam of his silver eyeglasses.
My last observation of two years ago shows that they have become somewhat less defined in appearance compared to back then, but they still maintain their unique charm and appeal after a couple of years.
As he/she grew old, the accumulated maturity adorned him/her even more brilliantly.
Ah, really amazed to such an extent that even later I had to hold my breath.

Neither had changed their dislike for sweets, including candies.
The menu we order is still similar. We had a reunion after so many years, but there was no greeting.
Capturing things inside our eyes is how we greet each other. Is this a product of the perfect moments from our past?
Or could that long gap between us have been the one to give me something?
The time we loved fiercely is already nothing but a memory, mocking me. I never ended it with you...
You seem like you have a lot on your mind that hurts.

Radiating under the scorching summer sun, my shimmering hair seemed to shine even more brightly. He gazed into his cold eyes.
Is it because you're not pleased with the changed appearance? While intently focusing for a while, I look straight into my own eyes.
It feels like it has been so long since we last met, but I am uncomfortable with the feeling of him looking at me. His gaze seems to have changed.
The perceived look of his/her eyes is different from before, causing anxiety to creep into the deep part of his heart.
He lowers his eyes shyly in an attempt to avoid being seen, but he is drawn to the unfamiliar object shining in his friend's hand.
"Oh! Did you get married, you?"

He/She said he/she was discharged from the hospital (and).
Translation:
So... did you make contact with your parents?
Did I get my face a bit rounder? Don't misunderstand, I was swollen. I didn't have any gap for fat. I reduced my food a little each time. Like girls on a diet, I didn't put anything in my mouth after 6 PM.
Jaejung. (spoken to him/her)
You're here for a meeting.

He/she/That person put on a somewhat awkward/confused/discomfited facial expression with my words.
The creases around my eyes deepen, and the fine lines on my eyelids grow more pronounced.
Whenever he made a frown, I was enchanted by how his face seemed to transform in an instant, and I cherished him even more because of that.
The thin face with its ostentatious eyebrows, the nose bridge as high as one's self-esteem, the plump lips eagerly searching for me.
All are the Jeong Yoonho that I loved.
I still yearn to touch a cheek as smooth as a boy with fever, and to give hand gestures like long ago.
After being completely mine, feeling him as such a distant figure is not desirable for me.
In fact, there's no difference between revealing my impatient heart through words or by circumventing them.
He knows me very well, with his silence revealing insights about the anxiety eating away at my inner self. It also gives an understanding of how he perceives this.
Reflecting on how everything around me has been transformed, my selfishness titters with irony.
You are not answering, this thing cannot become an interference factor within our circle.

I have been feeling really exhausted. You're the one I wanted to see most when I left the hospital, which is why I immediately ran here.
"Such words should have been spoken earlier."
I hadn't bought my own place yet and called you on impulse without thinking it through.

He/She laughs angrily/resentfully.
He needed to clear away the shopping items nearby in order to make a decent excuse.
The eyes alternately looking at me and my shopping bag express pity over both.
The meaningless breathing discards my intentions.
That sneaky, rising lip corner was longed for.
My Jung Yoon-ho, even now, after two years have passed, he still shines brightly and is beautiful like that.
If I were not decorated or embellished, I would be ugly. But you haven't changed at all.

Let me know if your home contacts can help with finding an apartment hotel. If they can't, I'll contact them on your behalf.
「Every day, being treated like a patient... is really annoying.」

You're the one who got rid of that den of iniquity.
But are you going to try bringing me back in again?
You were such a bad guy that you could grab someone's heart so tightly that it made for good jokes, weren't you?
You didn't do that. You never imagined insulting me like this. Don't insult me.

Then stay at Uncle's hotel. Let's go, I'll get you a room.
Translation: "My uncle is part of my family too. Don't you know it was me who made this mess?"
The light of acceptance shines on his face.
